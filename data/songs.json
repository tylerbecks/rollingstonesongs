The song, written by Lennon, is the tale of a late-night tryst — although it's electric with sexual possibility, the bemused cad ends up sleeping in the bathtub (and maybe takes his revenge by burning the place down the next morning). Lennon said that the lyrics disguised an actual affair: \"I was very careful and paranoid because I didn't want my wife, Cyn, to know that there was something going on.\"",

His opening lines — \"When I find myself in times of trouble/Mother Mary comes to me\" — were based on a dream in which his own late mother, Mary, offered solace during a tumultuous time for both the band and the culture, assuring him that everything would turn out fine. \"I'm not sure if she used the words 'Let it be,'\" McCartney recalled, \"but that was the gist of her advice.\" McCartney unveiled a skeletal version of \"Let It Be\" to the other Beatles at an even worse time: during the initial, disastrous Let It Be rehearsals in January 1969. John Lennon, the group's resident heretic, was brutally dismissive, mistaking McCartney's secular humanism for self-righteous piety. Yet the Beatles put special labor into the song, getting the consummate take on January 31st — the day after their last live performance, on the roof of their Apple offices in London. (R&B musician Billy Preston, a friend of the band's from its early days, contributed the gospel-flavored organ part.) George Harrison later took a couple of cracks at adding a guitar solo: The single version features his solo from April 30th, 1969, and the song cut's solo was taped at the final Beatles recording session, on January 4th, 1970. Released four months later, \"Let It Be\" effectively became an elegy for the band that had defined the Sixties.",

(The chorus, Leiber noted in 1987, was code for \"You ain't nothin' but a motherfucker.\") Presley, always on the lookout for hillbilly/R&B crossover possibilities, added the song to his stage act in the spring of 1956, after hearing Freddie Bell and the Bellboys sing it in Las Vegas. On June 5th of that year, his hip-swiveling performance of \"Hound Dog\" on The Milton Berle Show became an instant sensation — notorious enough that on his next TV appearance, he crooned the song to a top-hatted basset hound. The next morning, Presley and his band got deadly serious about \"Hound Dog,\" perfecting it over 31 takes at New York's RCA Studios. With snarling vocal authority, D.J. Fontana's tommy-gun drumrolls and slashing guitar by Scotty Moore, Presley transformed the song's blues changes and put-down rhymes into a declaration of independence from his generation's cold, rigid elders. \"Hound Dog\" was the flip side of \"Don't Be Cruel,\" Presley's third RCA single.

And it launched not one but two revolutions: late-Sixties psychedelia and the unprecedented genius of Jimi Hendrix. For the first time, Hendrix, bassist Noel Redding and drummer Mitch Mitchell got to show off their acrobatic onstage chemistry on record — and they somehow managed to condense it to an under-three-minute blaze of overdubbed guitar sorcery. (The first chord of its main riff has come to be known among guitarists as the \"Hendrix chord.\") The song, which Hendrix wrote on December 26th, 1966, in the dressing room of a London club, also served as a showcase for his brilliant, often contradictory lyrical gifts (boiled down from a much longer initial draft called \"Purple Haze — Jesus Saves\"). He spiked the surging rhythmic confidence of the Experience with intimate pictorial tension: \"Actin' funny, but I don't know why/'Scuse me while I kiss the sky.\" (Hendrix later said that he had written the lyrics after he'd had a dream in which he could walk underwater.) The Experience recorded \"Purple Haze\" across a series of sessions in January and February, 1967, experimenting with recording techniques such as the blitzed-out distortion on Hendrix's guitar — when the master tape was sent to their American record label, an enclosed note diligently pointed out that the distorted sound of the song was deliberate. In the closing solo, Hendrix echoed his screaming Strat with an additional shrieking guitar put through a new harmonic-manipulation device called an Octavia and played back at double speed. \"Purple Haze\" — the opening track on the U.S. version of his debut LP, Are You Experienced? — captured the liberating rush of Day-Glo culture just in time for the Summer of Love.",

So he and John Lennon went to the home of the parents of Jane Asher, McCartney's girlfriend, where — \"one on one, eyeball to eyeball,\" as Lennon put it — they wrote \"I Want to Hold Your Hand,\" an irresistibly erotic come-on framed as a chaste, bashful request. The lightning-bolt energy of their collaboration ran through the band's performance, taped October 17th, 1963. It lunges out of the speakers with a rhythm so tricky that the first wave of bands to cover the song often couldn't figure it out; Lennon and McCartney constantly switch between unison and harmonies, both of them snapping and whooping like they own the melody. Every element of the song is a hook, from Lennon's Chuck Berry riffing to George Harrison's string-snapping guitar fills to the quartet's syncopated hand claps. With advance orders at a million copies, \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" was released in the U.K. in late November, and promptly bumped the band's own \"She Loves You\" from the top of the charts.",

There are no other Beatles on the record. None were needed. George Martin's arrangement for a string quartet emphasized lower-octave melancholy, while McCartney's almost whispered vocal reverberated with longing in the big, dark spaces where drums and electric guitars would have been. The melody, he said, came to him in a dream: \"My dad used to know a lot of old jazz tunes, I thought maybe I'd just remembered it from the past.\" McCartney auditioned the song for Martin, with the working title \"Scrambled Eggs,\" in a hotel room in Paris in January 1964 — before the Beatles had even landed in America — but would not record it for another year and a half. \"We were a little embarrassed about it,\" McCartney confessed. \"We were a rock & roll band.\" A Number One single in America, \"Yesterday\" was, in his own words, \"the most complete song I have ever written.\"",

The song wasn't intended as a youth-mutiny anthem at first. It was a Jimmy Reed-style blues, reflecting Townshend's fears about the impending strictures of adult life, famously captured in the line \"Hope I die before I get old.\" \"My Generation' was very much about trying to find a place in society,\" he told Rolling Stone in 1987. \"I was very, very lost. The band was young then. It was believed that its career would be incredibly brief.\" Instead, \"My Generation\" became the Who's ticket to legend — their first British Top Five hit, and a battle cry for young mod rebels — and it established Townshend as a fearless and eloquent songwriter. \"My Generation\" went through months of arranging and rerecording before the Who got it right, in two takes, on October 13th, 1965. Townshend opened the song with a two-chord assault that beat punk rock to the punch by more than a decade. Bassist John Entwistle took the solo breaks with crisp, grunting aggression — he had to buy three new basses to finish the recording, since his Danelectro's strings kept breaking and replacement strings weren't available. (He ended up playing the song on a Fender.) Roger Daltrey's stuttering, howling performance, Townshend and Entwistle's R&B-inspired backing vocals, and the upward key changes created a vivid, mounting anxiety that climaxed with a studio re-creation of the Who's live gear-trashing finales, with Townshend spewing feedback all over Keith Moon's avalanche drumming. Four decades later, Townshend and Daltrey are all that remain of the original Who, and they still play \"My Generation\" at every show — now with the fire and wisdom of age.",

The fidelity was abysmal. Vig — about to work with Nirvana on their major-label debut, Nevermind — could not tell that the song would soon make underground Seattle rock the new mainstream and catapult Cobain, a troubled young man with strict indie-culture ethics, into megacelebrity. \"I could sort of hear the 'Hello, hello' part and the chords,\" Vig said years later. \"But it was so indecipherable that I had no idea what to expect.\"  Nor did anyone else. A shock wave of big-amp purity, \"Teen Spirit\" wiped the lingering jive of the Eighties off the pop map overnight. \"The song was a call to consciousness,\" Novoselic said in 2000 — Cobain's avenging grenade against the corporate invasion of youth culture, spiked with the demanding venom of the sneering chorus: \"Here we are now/Entertain us.\" The phrase was something Cobain used to say at parties — \"to break the ice,\" he said. \"That could have been him watching TV,\" said Novoselic, \"aghast at popular culture.\"  \"Teen Spirit,\" named after a brand of deodorant for girls, was Cobain's attempt to \"write the ultimate pop song,\" he said, using the soft-loud dynamic of his favorite band, the Pixies. The insidious hooks also showed his admiration for John Lennon. Cobain \"had that dichotomy of punk rage and alienation,\" Vig said, \"but also this vulnerable pop sensibility. In 'Teen Spirit,' a lot of that vulnerability is in the tone of his voice.\"  Sadly, by the time of Nirvana's last U.S. tour, in late '93, Cobain was tortured by the obligation to play \"Teen Spirit\" every night. \"There are many other songs that I have written that are as good, if not better,\" he claimed.

In Redding's reading, a brawny march, he called for equal favor with volcanic force. Franklin wasn't asking for anything. She sang from higher ground: a woman calling an end to the exhaustion and sacrifice of a raw deal with scorching sexual authority. In short, if you want some, you will earn it.",

    "song": " What’s Going On",
    "description": "\"What's Going On\" is an exquisite plea for peace on Earth, sung by a man at the height of crisis. In 1970, Marvin Gaye was Motown's top male vocal star, yet he was frustrated by the assembly-line role he played on his own hits. Devastated by the loss of duet partner Tammi Terrell, who died that March after a three-year battle with a brain tumor, Gaye was also trapped in a turbulent marriage to Anna Gordy, Motown boss Berry Gordy's sister. Gaye was tormented, too, by his relationship with his puritanical father, Marvin Sr. \"If I was arguing for peace,\" Gaye told biographer David Ritz, \"I knew I'd have to find peace in my heart.\"",

His wife, Yoko Ono, watched as Lennon sat at the white grand piano now known around the world from films and photographs of the sessions for his Imagine song and virtually completed the song: the serene melody; the pillowy chord progression; that beckoning, four-note figure; and nearly all of the lyrics, 22 lines of graceful, plain-spoken faith in the power of a world, united in purpose, to repair and change itself.",
